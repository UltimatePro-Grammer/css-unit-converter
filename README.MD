## What is this
   - It's a site that converts pixels to other CSS units.
## Why does this exist
   - For CSS golfing([cssbattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev)).
   - The experiences I've had with the current tools that exist for such purposes were not good, so I decided to make it myself, and in website form to be more accesible.
